# HOME-BIO DOCKERFILE

sHOtgun MEtagenomic analysis of BIOlogical entities (HOME-BIO) is a dockerized solution for metagenomics. Inside a DOCKER image, we installed UBUNTU with Python 3.7, Python 2.7, and Anaconda 3 (V. 2020/02).
Inside an anaconda base environment, we installed two common metagenomics software, [KAIJU](http://kaiju.binf.ku.dk/) and [KRAKEN 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/), and other mandatory software for the pipeline. For the complete list, please read our paper here (link)
